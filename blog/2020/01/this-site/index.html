        <p>Update (2020.03.07): This site now uses Hugo.</p>
<p>This site is an experiment in how far I can get in making a personal site without relying on any build tools/libraries, just using raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
<p>At first, I was just gonna use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, as I&rsquo;ve done for previous versions of this site, but when I took a look at the repo for the first time in a few months, I saw there were two libraries that I needed to upgrade to fix security vulnerabilities, and I just could not be bothered.</p>
<p>Next, I considered <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enjoy the power of the latest web technologies – React.js, Webpack, modern JavaScript and CSS and more — all set up and waiting for you to start building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sounds exactly like I what I do at work! Maybe once I start fleshing this site out I&rsquo;ll pull in something like Gatsby, but I&rsquo;m having so much more fun just writing everything from scratch.</p>
<p>That being said, I will try to mostly write about non-web dev things on this site. Things I&rsquo;m interested in: photography, music (both as a musician and listener), lifting, travel, backpacks, minimalism.</p>
