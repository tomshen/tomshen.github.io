                    This site is an experiment in how far I can get in making a personal site without relying on any build tools/libraries, just using raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, I was just gonna use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, as I've done for previous versions of this site, but when I took a look at the repo for the first time in a few months, I saw there were two libraries that I needed to upgrade to fix security vulnerabilities, and I just could not be bothered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I considered <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, but:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Enjoy the power of the latest web technologies – React.js, Webpack, modern JavaScript and CSS and more — all set up and waiting for you to start building.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    sounds exactly like I what I do at work! Maybe once I start fleshing this site out I'll pull in something like Gatsby, but I'm having so much more fun just writing everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, I will try to mostly write about non-web dev things on this site. Things I'm interested in: photography, music (both as a musician and listener), lifting, travel, backpacks, minimalism.
