The answer is generally not the presence of police (a neighborhood where you frequently see police officers is certainly not a safe neighborhood).

      <description>(Disclaimer: this is an unedited rough draft.)  I promised to not write about backpacks, but here we are. Let&#39;s just get all of this out of my system now so that I never have to write about backpacks again. I&#39;m going to talk about backpacks that I use, backpacks that I recommend, and backpacks that I do not.  I&#39;m mostly interested in bags that are useful for EDC and for one-bag urban travel.</description>

      <description>Update (2020.03.07): This site now uses Hugo. Turns out having to manually sync head tags and nav between multiple pages is no fun. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy fast (compared to Jekyll), but somehow manages to be even more confusing to use.
This site is an experiment in how far I can get in making a personal site without relying on any build tools/libraries, just using raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
At first, I was just gonna use Jekyll, as I&amp;rsquo;ve done for previous versions of this site, but when I took a look at the repo for the first time in a few months, I saw there were two libraries that I needed to upgrade to fix security vulnerabilities, and I just could not be bothered.</description>
