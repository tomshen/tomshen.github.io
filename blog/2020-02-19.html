                <h4>The uses of sidewalks: safety</h4>
                <p>
                    What makes neighborhoods safe and unsafe? The answer is generally not the presence of police (a neighborhood where you frequently see police officers is certainly not a safe neighborhood). Instead, neighborhoods depend on having people watching the street. These people can be hired (e.g. doormen), or they can be people who run or work at businesses on the street (e.g. owners/workers at bodegas that are open all night long), or they can be people who live in the neighborhood and, critically, are interested in watching the street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, safe neighborhoods are due to a combination of the last two, and they're connected. Why do people watch the street? When there's a lot of other people in the street. People are in the street when there's something drawing them to or through the neighborhood. This is where mixed use zoning and density come in: the more there is to draw people to the streets that people also live in, the safer they'll be. Also, somewhat ironically, the more strangers frequent a street, the safer it is.

                    Today, New York (and cities in the US in general) are a lot safer than they used to be (e.g. when this book was written). Manhattan in particular is a lot safer. However, as far as I can tell very few neighborhoods in Manhattan have the sort of neighborhood feel that Jacobs describes. So, why have they become more safe?

                    A related tidbit that caught my eye: neighborhoods that are filled with high end residential buildings are kept safe primarily through a <q>network of doormen and superintendents, of delivery boys and nursemaids, a form of hired neighborhood.</q> (p. 40) Since residents of high-rent neighborhoods don't actually spend much time in their neighborhoods, part of their rent goes towards a "fake" neighborhood infrastructure. In that sense, should we be more suspicious of doorman buildings? (I currently live in a doorman building.)

                    How do we deal with unsafe cities?

                        [One] mode is to take refuge in vehicles. This is a technique practiced in the big wild-animal reservations of Africa, where tourists are warned to leave their cars under no circumstances until they reach a lodge. It is also the technique practiced in Los Angeles. Surprised visitors to that city are forever recounting how the police of Beverly Hills stopped them, made them prove their reasons for being afoot, and warned them of the danger. This technique of public safety does not seem to work too effectively yet in Los Angeles, as the crime rate shows, but in time it may. And think what the crime figures might be if more people without metal shells were helpless upon the vast, blind-eyed reservation of Los Angeles.

                    The other modes, of course, are to simply let residents deal with it, or to establish turfs. Turfs are sometimes actually maintained by gangs, but walled off parts of the city and gated communities create their own turfs.
