    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tomshen/ml-kit">ml-kit</a></h3>
    <p>
      I noticed that while Python and Java have powerful and popular native toolkits for machine learning (e.g. <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a> for Python, <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> for Java), JavaScript seemed to lack one. So, I decided to create one for Node.js.
    </p>
    <h2>Past Projects</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://www.tomshen.me/sasstastic/">Sasstastic</a></h3>
    <p>
      CSS preprocessors like LESS and Sass have become increasingly common in web development because they offer a cleaner, more maintainable way to write stylesheets. However, most stylesheets on the web today are still written with pure CSS. Sasstastic converts CSS to SCSS to automate some of the transition from CSS to Sass. It was developed and won Best Design at <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackcmu">HackCMU 2013</a>.

    <h3><a href="http://drizzledrive.herokuapp.com/">DrizzleDrive</a></h3>
    <p>
      Dropbox is an awesome way to access your files anywhere you go, but it doesn't offer an easy way to edit them. DrizzleDrive solves this problem by integrating Google Docs with Dropbox. The web app allows users to browse their Dropbox files and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in Google Docs. All changes are synced back to Dropbox without having to download or upload anything. I developed DrizzleDrive at <a href="http://2013.tartanhacks.com/">TartanHacks 2013</a>.

    <h3><a href="http://print.scottylabs.org">Print@ScottyLabs</a></h3>
    <p>
      Print@ScottyLabs allows CMU students to print documents through email. To use the service, a student just has to send an email with an attachment to <a href="mailto:print@scottylabs.org">print@scottylabs.org</a> from their school email. It allows students to print from phones, tablets, and computers without having to install print drivers. The service was developed with other members of <a href="http://www.scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a>, a campus organization devoted to help students implement their ideas.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/tomshen/checkmeout">Check Me Out</a></h3>
    <p>
      I've found that one of the most common use cases for <a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a> is splitting checks. However, to use Venmo, you still have to do quite a bit of arithmetic to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. Check Me Out is a mobile app that solves this problem: users log into Venmo, take a picture of the check to split, and select which items to charge to which of their Venmo friends. The app takes care of totalling up the items, and charges each person the proper amount for the check. It uses the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract OCR engine</a> to read checks, and the Venmo API to charge users. It was developed at <a href="http://www.hackmit.org/">HackMIT Fall 2013</a>.
