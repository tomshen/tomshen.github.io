# Hi! I'm Tom Shen.

![Me!](/assets/img/tom-shen.jpg){: .profile-picture }

I'm a software engineer living in NYC. I enjoy drinking coffee and [reading lots of books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5829577-tom-shen). I'm currently trying to [read a book a week for a year](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/4233843).

Currently, I work at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com). Previously, I've worked at [expii](https://www.expii.com), [Upthere](https://www.upthere.com), and [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com). I studied computer science and machine learning at [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu).
