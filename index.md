Hi! I'm currently a senior studying computer science and machine learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I'm Director of Technology of [ScottyLabs](http://scottylabs.org/), a student organization at CMU that runs educational events teaching programming and design, develops services for the campus community, and organizes a hackathon called [TartanHacks](http://tartanhacks.com/). I currently work as a web developer for a startup part-time. In the past, I've worked at [Upthere](https://www.upthere.com/) and [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy obsessing over coffee, reading books, and going to hackathons.
