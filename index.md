Hi! I am a senior at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/), studying computer science and machine learning. I currently work as a web developer for a startup part-time. In the past, I've worked at [Upthere](https://www.upthere.com/) and [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy obsessing over coffee, reading books, and going to hackathons.
