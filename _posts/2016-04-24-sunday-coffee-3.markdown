Not much to say this week, except I'm not sure how much I actually enjoy writing. I read [a blog post on ending a blog](http://with.thegra.in/end-state), and I'm not sure what *my* end state is. What am I trying to get out of writing?

Here's some interesting links for the week:

## Links

- Carrying ten weapons while running and slaughtering enemies in FPSs (specifically, Doom) isn't *that* unreasonable, [according to MythBusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8dhMF3IqbY).
- The Onion on sexism at work: [Woman Leaving Meeting Worried She Came Off As Too Competent](http://www.theonion.com/article/woman-leaving-meeting-worried-she-came-too-compete-52771).
- A [collection of "brutalist" websites](http://brutalistwebsites.com/) [floated around social media](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11517491) this past week. I wouldn't call them truly brutalist, since they all use extensive amounts of CSS, but there are some interesting site designs. I particularly liked the one that was [just a Google Doc in an `<iframe>`](http://carlyayres.com/) and [the site for Bloomberg Businessweek's design conference](http://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/design-conference/).
- A [remarkably hard-hitting investigation into how fake "farm-to-table" tends to be](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/food/farm-to-fable/restaurants/).
