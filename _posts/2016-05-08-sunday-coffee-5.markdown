This will probably be the last week I write one of these posts. As I've said previously, I'm not sure I'm quite getting anything out of this. I still want to share and comment on random articles I find throughout the week, but it makes much more sense to do so on social media, where I can actually engage in conversation. However, I still want to write proper, longer posts, so keep an eye out for those.

- A bunch of online portfolios were [rebooted](http://www.may1reboot.com/) (redesigned) on May 1. The featured ones are all really good, but I really liked [Eli.wtf](http://eli.wtf/). Animation (not via flash) is very underused in the modern web.
- Steven Sinofsky wrote a [great article on using a tablet as a laptop replacement](https://medium.com/learning-by-shipping/my-tablet-has-stickers-8f7ab9022ebd). I liked how this mindset was communicated through putting stickers on it, the same way you would a laptop.
- I recently discovered the Lyttle Lytton Contest, a competition to find the worst opening sentences to novels, both original and found. [Here's the 2016 winners](http://adamcadre.ac/16lyttle.html).
- Bethany Heck on [multi-typeface designs, and going against common design "wisdom"](https://blog.prototypr.io/the-value-of-multi-typeface-design-ccd67227b0ee): "Don't design for other designers, design for your audience."
- [Trump is merely the latest iteration of the Republican Party's insidious racism](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/trump-reagan-nixon-republican-party-racism).
- I've been unconsciously aware of this for a while now, but Chinese fonts have the equivalent of serif and sans-serif! Here's an [excellent introduction to Chinese typography](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-chinese-fonts--cms-23444).
