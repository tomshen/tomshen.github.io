I recently read an [article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification) (discovered via [things magazine](http://www.thingsmagazine.net/colour-me-beautiful/)) on how "Silicon Valley helps spread the same sterile aesthetic across the world." The core premise is that technology (Airbnb and social media) is creating "Airspace" (à la *Up in the Air*'s "Airworld"):

> It’s the realm of coffee shops, bars, startup offices, and co-live / work spaces that share the same hallmarks everywhere you go: a profusion of symbols of comfort and quality, at least to a certain connoisseurial mindset. Minimalist furniture. Craft beer and avocado toast. Reclaimed wood. Industrial lighting. Cortados. Fast internet. The homogeneity of these spaces means that traveling between them is frictionless, a value that Silicon Valley prizes and cultural influencers like Schwarzmann take advantage of. Changing places can be as painless as reloading a website. You might not even realize you’re not where you started.

The article mentions this, but I think modern lifestyle magazines are responsible for this as well. I touched on this in an [earlier post]({% post_url 2016-04-17-sunday-coffee-2 %}#kinfolk-and-the-desaturation-aesthetic), and I still mostly agree with what I said--this aesthetic is boring and bougie. But, it's also consistent and comfortable, and [cheap as fuck](https://www.metafilter.com/161423/AirSpace#6654764) (that MetaFilter thread has a lot of smug tech/millenial hatred, but also a lot of great discussion, including a nice diversion on Aldi).

Plus, complaining that you see the same coffee shops and bars when you travel is a little silly, since it turns out the same things that appeal to people in their twenties with internet access in New York and San Francisco also tend to appeal to those around the world. [From the same MetaFilter thread](https://www.metafilter.com/161423/AirSpace#6655130):

> I once saw someone bemoan that a Taiwanese cafe in Toronto, which was all exposed brick and Edison bulbs etc., wasn't as "authentic" as the cheap dumpling place down the street, Chinatown was turning generic etc. etc. but really, that's what cafes in Taiwan today actually look like. If they'd paid attention to the menu and knew something about food in Asia, they would have found that it served very much an Asian take on "Western" food (which is pretty distinct from the "fusion" styles that originate from here). Like, sorry the rest of the world did not freeze in time so you could go feel like an ~adventurous traveller~.

At the end of the day, I'm not sure I'd want the place I live or the place I work to subscribe to Airspace aesthetics. Startups may need to be in [disposable office spaces](http://wg420b.tumblr.com/post/112674605896/silicon-valley-and-the-end-of-architecture), but why are so many other tech companies imitating it or refusing to grow out of it? But honestly, I'm kinda okay with it when I travel. When I travel, I'd rather the place I stay in be comfortable and safe rather than too adventurous, and reserve my energy for what I'm actually traveling to do, whether it be work or pleasure.
