Inspired by [various](http://www.mbs-p-b.com/mbs-p-b/2016/4/16/a-players-week-of-april-10th) [other](http://www.analogsenses.com/2016/04/16/morning-coffee/) [weekly](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/the-sunday-papers/) links posts, I decided to retroactively rename this to "Sunday Coffee," (because I am very original) and flesh it out a bit more.

## Kinfolk and the Desaturation Aesthetic

I recently read an [article on how Kinfolk is "the last lifestyle magazine"](http://www.racked.com/2016/3/14/11173148/kinfolk-lifestyle-magazines) and how it "created the dominant aesthetic of the decade with perfect lattes and avocado toast." As someone who very much enjoys both lattes and avocado toast, I went out and purchased the [latest issue of Kinfolk](http://www.kinfolk.com/shops/magazine/kinfolk-issue-nineteen-2/) and read it cover to cover.

Kinfolk is *boring.* Outside a series of [neat photographs](http://www.kinfolk.com/in-anxious-anticipation/) (skip the essay), Kinfolk is a magazine full of bland, mostly white people posing and doing absolutely nothing of interest. The writing is dull purple prose, and even the photography is desaturated.

The thing is, Kinfolk really should appeal a lot more to me. I'm in my early twenties, live in NYC, drink a lot of and think a lot about coffee, and even own a record player. But why does that mean my life should be empty and devoid of color?

Okay, so maybe it's just Kinfolk in particular that doesn't sit right with me. Fortunately, the article I linked helpfully has a list of "Kinfolk's Kin," other lifestyle magazines that have sprung up around Kinfolk's surge in popularity. One of them, Cereal, recently put out a [new issue](http://readcereal.com/magazine/volume-11/), which I recently read a [rave review](http://thenewsprint.co/2016/04/15/cereal-volume-11/) about. So, I trekked out to [one of the few nearby stockists](http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/) and checked it out.

Cereal, too, is boring. Admittedly, the paper and binding *were* very nice, but it suffered from the same problems as Kinfolk. The photos looked like someone laid tracing paper on top of them, and the prose was lifeless.

I just don't get why this aesthetic is so popular. Maybe I just have shit taste. Anyways, here's the most interesting posts/articles/whatever I encountered this week:

- Emoji do not belong to Apple and predate the iPhone: ["Apple did not invent emoji"](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/04/12/apple-did-not-invent-emoji/).
- I recently discovered Tim Urban through his posts on [doing a TED talk](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html) and his excellent series on [Elon Musk](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html). He does really enthusiastic, in-depth explorations (sorta like Eevee, above) of a wide range of topics.
- Goblin Punch has an excellent post on ["Least Priests, Pantheism, and God-Prisons"](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/10/least-priests-pantheism-and-god-prisons.html), based vaguely on [religion in ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome).
- [Calvin Godfrey reports on a culture where people eat dogs, steal dogs, and murder thieves, but no one wants to talk about it](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2016/the-dog-thief-killings/).
- Impossible, manufacturers of "Polaroid" instant film, are now [making an instant camera](https://us.impossible-project.com/pages/impossible-i-1-analog-instant-camera) too. I really like instant photos--I even have an old Polaroid camera laying around--but I'm not sure I'm hipster enough to buy this.
- In a similar vein as [King James Programming](http://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/), [Classical Programmer Paintings](http://classicprogrammerpaintings.tumblr.com/) pairs old oil paintings with captions describing the developers and designers they could be depicting.
- [Recovering from `rm -rf *` without `/bin`](https://macnugget.org/mirrors/unix-horror-story).
- Paul Graham gave a talk on ["How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub"](http://paulgraham.com/pgh.html). It might even happen before the Year of the Linux Desktop.
- The Allusionist is always delightful, but I particularly enjoyed the [recent episode on the differing usage of "please" in the UK and the US](http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/please).
