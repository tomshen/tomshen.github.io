![Wabi-Sabi](/assets/img/wabi-sabi.jpg)

Leonard Koren does a good job of stating wabi-sabi plainly and clearly. The basic, core concepts of wabi-sabi are nice. Unfortunately, in practice, wabi-sabi is pretentious false humility for the wealthy: like "Marie Antoinette's playing shepherdess and milkmaid" but "much more serious." To be fair, Koren does a good job of discussing this in the text notes, but at the end of the book, I have even less respect for wabi-sabi (and especially its practitioners) than when I started.
