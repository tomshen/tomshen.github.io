*Spoilers Ahead*

<!--more-->

*Ghostwritten* is a set of ten short stories tightly woven together. They're all set in the same world, of course, but characters all interact, sometimes very obviously and sometimes very subtly. Each story is about the main character finding his or her (or its) place in the world. Places are *alive* in *Ghostwritten*, sometimes literally with ghosts. I really loved how many of the characters were deeply flawed but remained relatable and even likable.

Thoughts on each story:

- "Okinawa": Reading from the perspective of someone who is clearly insane is lots of fun.
- "Tokyo": Cute, though honestly this could've been written by Murakami.
- "Hong Kong": He's an absolute asshole, but I like him a lot, and I like the maid even more.
- "Holy Mountain": After the relative lightness of the first three stories, this one was a gut punch. I admired her resilience.
- "Mongolia": I like how immortality does not mean omnipotence or even competence. I feel like the theme of finding one's place shines through most obviously here, but I still liked how it made its choice in the end.
- "Petersburg": If you have to keep telling yourself something, it's probably not true. I felt pity for the failed femme fatale.
- "London": What a wild day. This one reminded me a lot of *High Fidelity*, especially with his decision at the end.
- "Clear Island": The island is such a cozy place. I love how she's been wandering through all the previous stories.
- "Night Train": This was a little heavy-handed, but I still enjoyed the idea of a late-night radio DJ broadcasting through the end of the world.
- "Underground": And it all comes full circle.
