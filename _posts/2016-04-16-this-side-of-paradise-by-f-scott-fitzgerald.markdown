I started off really disliking *This Side of Paradise*--every character in the book is conceited and selfish, but Amory is even more so. By the end of the book though, I couldn't help but want him to succeed. The book is very well-written, especially considering it was F. Scott Fitzgerald's first novel. The beginning is a little boring and stuffy, but it picks up a lot by the time the second book starts.

As a side note, this book reminded me a lot of *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*--Amory even reads it and finds himself "‚Äãpuzzled and depressed." Remarkably, Fitzgerald's *Bildungsroman* is even more experimental than Joyce's.
