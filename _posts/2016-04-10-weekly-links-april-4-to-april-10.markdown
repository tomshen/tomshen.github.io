I spend a lot of time reading stuff on the internet, and I often encounter really cool stuff that I want to share with other people. Rather than scattering these links between Pinboard, Tumblr and Twitter, I figured it would be nicer to collect them all in once place. Plus, I needed something to force me to post to this blog semi-regularly. Thus, here's some of the most interesting things I've read and/or seen on the internet this week:

- Old photographs of cities reshot today: [Paris](http://golem13.fr/paris-fenetres-histoire/) and [cities in China](http://petapixel.com/2016/04/09/reshot-old-photos-see-china-changed-100-years/).

- The map is acutally not the territory: [the Chinese government forces mapmakers to offset their maps](http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/digital-maps-skewed-china).

- [Photoshop's PSD file format is terrible, but it also enables files created decades to be opened today.](https://posts.postlight.com/fun-photoshop-file-format-facts-edbc1374c715)

- "Even your mom" is a sexist, ageist description often applied to games. [What happens when a mother actually tries to play some modern video games?](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/04/even-your-mom/)

- [On environmental design in *Firewatch* and *The Witness*](http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2016/03/a-history-and-triumph-of-environment.html)

- American culture (the sort that's taught explictly and implicity in elementary school) is the [closest modern analogue to ancient religions](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/08/a-theory-of-religion/).
