![A Burglar's Guide to the City](/assets/img/a-burglars-guide-to-the-city.jpeg)

I really wanted to like *A Burglar's Guide to the City*. I'm an avid reader of [BLDGBLOG](http://www.bldgblog.com/), and the concept behind the book sounded quite interesting--see architecture the way a burglar does. And indeed the book does have a lot of interesting anecdotes, but it's also very repetitive. Each chapter is a simple idea repeated over and over again. It was still an enjoyable read overall, but it wasn't as great as I hoped.

I'd suggest checking out BLDGBLOG and a [recent Gastropod episode on food theft](https://gastropod.com/grand-theft-food/) first.

*Also on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1602838383)*.
