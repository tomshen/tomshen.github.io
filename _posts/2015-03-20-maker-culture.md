# [Why I Am Not a Maker](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/)

Debbie Chachra introduces the idea of "making" as a traditionally male domain. That's a really good point that I hadn't considered before, and the counterexamples proposed in the comments (cooking, homemaking) don't really hold up.

However, I disagree with the central point of the article, that maker culture "risks ignoring those who teach, criticize, and take care of others."

## Programmers Aren't Special
In Silicon Valley, those that code undeniably get more pay and prestige. However, this is also true of lawyers at law firms, bankers at Wall Street, and doctors at hospitals. At any company, those who are most directly responsible for the main product or service are naturally those paid the best. And, at software companies, those people tend to be the ones writing the code.

That's not to say those who perform other tasks at software companies aren't doing useful work, it's just that their work has a less direct impact on the company's success. Similarly, if you look at programmers that work at financial companies, they are treated just like any other non-banker.

## Making vs Non-making
Chachra states that maker culture considers non-making "repair, analysis, and especially caregiving." I would say that more commonly, the antithesis of making is consumption--passively consuming that which others have made. (I also think that Chachra greatly misunderstood Ayn Rand. Rand was not denigrating teachers or caregivers, but those who did not contribute to society.)

American culture is heavily based on consumption--[the average American spends nearly three hours a day watching television][american-tv]. But now that "making" is easily within the grasp of most Americans, whether it be through art classes at the local community college or, yes, learning to code online, I don't think it's a bad thing to encourage people to at least try making something. And, although Chachra seems to disagree with me, I think the true mark of a civilized society is one in which every person can, if he or she so choses, create something themselves.
